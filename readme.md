## Key Insights for Presentation

I was just concerned with discovering the elements of the *number of trips* and the *trip duration*
I began to look at the *Age Categories* and *Age*of customers and how many trips each type and age. 
Then I looked at the *gender of customer* and how many trips each type of gender customer had. 
Then I looked at the *type of customer* and how many trips each type of customer had. 
then I lookes at the *distribution of Duration Time* in seconds and *number of Trips*.
Then I looked at the *days of the week* and the *number of trips* in each day. 
Then I looked at the *gender f customers* and the *age Categories* to the *number of trips*. 
Then I looked at the *gender of customers* and the *duration in seconds*.
Then I looked at the *user type* and the *duration in seconds*.
Then I looked at the *user type* and the *the days of the week*.
Then I looked relation between *age Categories* and *number of trips* and *the days of the week*.
Then I looked relation between *gender of customers* and *number of trips* and *the days of the week*.
Then I looked relation between *Members gender*, *the days of the week* and *length of trip in minutes*.
